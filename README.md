# File Organizer

A trust-centered macOS filesystem organization tool that makes changes explainable, reversible, and unsurprising.

## Overview

File Organizer is a macOS application designed with a fundamental principle: **correctness and trust take precedence over convenience and cleverness**. It helps users organize their files through declarative rules while maintaining complete transparency and reversibility of all operations.

### Core Philosophy

- **Explainable**: Every action has a human-readable reason
- **Reversible**: All changes can be safely undone
- **Unsurprising**: No automatic execution, no hidden behavior
- **Conservative**: When uncertain, skip and explain rather than guess

## Features

- **File Scanning**: Traverse directories and discover files with metadata
- **Rule-Based Organization**: Define declarative rules for file management
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch filesystem changes with FSEvents
- **Undo Support**: Full undo capability for all operations
- **Modern UI**: Clean SwiftUI interface for file management

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 or later
- Swift 5.9+
- Xcode 15.0+

## Building

### Using Swift Package Manager

```bash
# Build the project
swift build

# Build release version
swift build -c release

# Run the application
swift run Clippy
```

### Using Xcode

1. Open `Package.swift` in Xcode
2. Select the `Clippy` scheme
3. Press ⌘R to build and run

## Architecture

The system is built on strict separation of concerns with a modular architecture:

### Modules

#### ClippyCore (Library)
Pure domain models with no dependencies on other modules.

- **FileDescriptor** (`FileDescriptor.swift`): Immutable file snapshot
- **DomainModels** (`DomainModels.swift`): Rules, Plans, Actions, Conditions

#### ClippyEngine (Library)
Business logic engines that depend on ClippyCore.

- **FileScanner**: Read-only filesystem enumeration
- **Planner**: Pure logic evaluation of files against rules
- **ExecutionEngine**: Performs approved filesystem operations
- **UndoEngine**: Reverses executed actions using logs
- **FileSystemObserver**: Passive filesystem event monitoring via FSEvents
- **ScanBridge**: Connects Observer events to staleness suggestions
- **RuleTemplates**: Pre-defined rule templates

#### Clippy (Executable)
The application layer combining UI and engines.

## Workflow

```
1. User selects folder
2. Scanner reads filesystem → [FileDescriptor]
3. User creates/enables Rules
4. Planner evaluates files against rules → ActionPlan
5. User reviews plan (with explanations)
6. User approves
7. Execution Engine executes → ExecutionLog
8. User can undo via UndoEngine ← ExecutionLog
```

## Rules

Rules are declarative policies defining conditions and desired outcomes:

```swift
Rule(
    name: "Archive PDFs",
    description: "Move old PDF files to archive",
    conditions: [
        .fileExtension(is: "pdf"),
        .modifiedBefore(date: thirtyDaysAgo)
    ],
    outcome: .move(to: archiveURL)
)
```

### Conditions

- `fileExtension(is: String)`
- `fileName(contains: String)`
- `fileSize(largerThan: Int64)`
- `createdBefore(date: Date)`
- `modifiedBefore(date: Date)`
- `isDirectory`

### Outcomes

- `move(to: URL)` - Move to specified folder
- `copy(to: URL)` - Copy to specified folder
- `delete` - Move to system Trash (reversible)
- `rename(prefix: String?, suffix: String?)` - Rename with prefix/suffix
- `skip(reason: String)` - Explicitly do nothing

## System Contract

The system operates under a strict contract defined in `docs/formalSystemContract.md`:

### Key Invariants

1. **No Unplanned Mutation**: Filesystem writes require explicit `ActionPlan` approval
2. **Observation Is Non-Causal**: Events never trigger automatic execution
3. **Reversibility Over Destruction**: "Delete" means "move to Trash", never permanent
4. **Undo Is Conservative**: Skips when restoration is unsafe
5. **Explanation Is Mandatory**: Every action and skip includes reasoning
6. **Stale Is Acceptable, Wrong Is Not**: System tolerates staleness but never guesses

### Responsibility Boundaries

| Subsystem      | Read FS | Write FS | Decide | Observe |
|----------------|---------|----------|--------|---------|
| Scanner        | ✓       | ✗        | ✗      | ✗       |
| Planner        | ✗       | ✗        | ✓      | ✗       |
| Executor       | ✗       | ✓        | ✗      | ✗       |
| Undo Engine    | ✗       | ✓        | ✗      | ✗       |
| Observer       | ✗       | ✗        | ✗      | ✓       |

## Safety Features

### Conflict Resolution

When multiple rules match a file with different outcomes, the Planner:
1. Detects the conflict
2. Skips the file
3. Explains: "Conflict! Multiple rules matched with different outcomes"

### Execution Safety

- Never overwrites existing files
- Creates parent directories as needed
- Logs all failures without aborting entire plan
- Handles permission errors gracefully

### Undo Safety

- Only attempts to reverse successful actions
- Checks filesystem state before restoration
- Skips when original location is occupied
- Explains every skip decision

## Failure Philosophy

The system explicitly prefers:

- **Skip** over guess
- **Explanation** over retry
- **Safety** over completeness
- **Predictability** over cleverness

Failures are expected and accepted. Surprises are not.
